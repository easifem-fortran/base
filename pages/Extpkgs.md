# External dependencies of EASIFEM-base

For some of its functionality EASIFEM depends upon following fortran-libraries, which are brain children of the great fortran developers. Note that some of these libraries have been suitably modified to serve the desire purpose.

### PENF

PENF is developed  by [Mr. Szaghi](https://github.com/szaghi). This library tries to exploit code portability for modern (2003+) Fortran projects. It is a pure Fortran library for achieving portable codes for modern Fortran projects. It  provides many number-to-string and vice-versa facilities.

### BeFoR64

This library is also a fortran project of [Mr. Szaghi](https://github.com/szaghi). It is for *base64* encoding/decoding for modern Fortran projects. [Read more](https://github.com/szaghi/BeFoR64)

### StringiFor

This library is also a fortran project of [Mr. Szaghi](https://github.com/szaghi). This library makes an attempt to define string data type for handling characters in an object oriented way.  [Read more](https://github.com/szaghi/StringiFor)

### FoXy

This is a fortran library which is designed to handle XML files. [Read more](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/FoXy)

### vtkFortran

This fortran library handles IO with vtk files. [Read more](https://github.com/szaghi/VTKFortran)

### H5Fortran

This fortran project, which is developed by [Michael Hirsch](https://github.com/scivision), can handle IO with hdf5 files. [Read more](https://github.com/geospace-code/h5fortran.git).

### Functional-fortran

This modern fortran project is developed by [Milan Curcic](https://github.com/milancurcic). This library facilitates a set of commonly used tools in functional programming. [Read more](https://github.com/wavebitscientific/functional-fortran)

### OGPF

This is program creates an interface between modern fortran and gnuplot. This is a useful library for visualising fortran data using gnuplot. [Read more](https://github.com/kookma/ogpf)

### Sparsekit

Sparsekit is a legacy fortran code written by the great [Yusef Saad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yousef_Saad) for peforming linear algebra with sparse matrices. [Read more](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/software/SPARSKIT/)
