! summary:         intersection of plane and line in 3D.
!
!# Introduction
!
!    The normal form of a plane in 3D is:
!
!      PP is a point on the plane,
!      N is a normal vector to the plane.
!
!    The explicit form of a line in 3D is:
!
!      P1, P2 are two points on the line.
!
!# Parameters:
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) PP(3), a point on the plane.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) NORMAL(3), a normal vector to the plane.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) P1(3), P2(3), two distinct points on the line.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) IVAL, the kind of intersection;
!    0, the line and plane seem to be parallel and separate;
!    1, the line and plane intersect at a single point;
!    2, the line and plane seem to be parallel and joined.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) PINT(3), the coordinates of a
!    common point of the plane and line, when IVAL is 1 or 2.
